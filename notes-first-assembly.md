#Notes- First Assembly#

##Tools
* Ball-end Metric Hex key set
* Rubber mallet (optional)
* M5 drill bit (optional)
* ~1/2" binder clips (3 or 6) to mount bed.

##Part Notes

###Frame Motor
* M3 8mm are perfect (steppers)
* M3 screw holes need to have enough clearance to drop through
* M5 14mm work for the vertical vslot anchors
* M5 10mm crossbeam vslot NO WASHERS
* M5 12mm crossbeam vslot WITH WASHERS
* Vslot cutouts almost perfect, self cleaning

###frame_vertex
* M8 screw cuts threads well for the first portion, and well enough for the second. 
* M5 14mm work for the vertical vslot anchors
* Vslot cutouts almost perfect, self cleaning
* Order of operations: Crossbeam tslot installation before M8 idler pulley installation.


## Crossbeam lengths

### Mounting Plate 3 Points of Contact

* Crossbeam lengths (214mm*2)=428mm crossbeams (212-213mm)
* :. Vertical beam = 644mm (~425-500mm Z height)
* One 1500mm Vslot length will yield ((2*428mm)+644mm)


## Assembly

* Cut slowly, less cleanup
* When assembling vertices, assemble snug, loosen afterthings are together, square up then tighten.
* 

## Working cuts

* Misuimi 428mm (9 cross bars)
* Vslot 1M (3 vertical bars)
* 
## Bed mounting 

* M5 12mm (currently unless we countersink) low profile (openbuilds)

## Assembling Triangles

* 2 assemblies (bar, vertex, bar) & (vertex, bar, vertex)
* Double flanged bearings (2xF608ZZ)
* The double flanged bearings are to be installed last.

## Assembling uprights

* All vertical bars need to be flush with the bottom surface
* 

## Vertical bar considerations

* 750mm seems to be the sweet spot
* 1m has wobble
* 

# Mechanical notes

## Motors

* Derpstock nameplate is front and center
* X motor Front right
* Y motor Front Left
* Z motor Rear Center
* Movement of effector plate follows traditional XY movement
* 

# Wiring

## Effector
* 10 pin connector or:
* 6 Pin connector at the base for effector wiring (bed leveling)
    * 2 pins for microswitch
    * 3 pins for Servo
        * Servo and cooling fan share ground
    * 2 pins for fan
* 4 pin connector for hot end
    * 2 pins for hot end
    * 2 pins for thermistor
